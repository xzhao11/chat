The project is a simple chat program that allows clients to chat across servers using TCP.
The client would send different commands to the server to build new connection, send message to specified clients, broadcast message, or get information about other clients.
The server is responsible for handling the commands and transferring the messages to corresponded clients.
All packets are sent out and received using TCP.
The files which contains my own work includes cclient, server, sendRecvPdu, packet and handleTable.
I am proud of this project because though it is a low-level program, I was able to build it from ground up and it was super satisfying when it actually built connection and sent messages between servers just by passing packets around. It showed me the magic of computer science which make me obsessed.
